Get the transactions with PLANETS amount greater than 0 from Algoexplorer.io for a given Algorand Wallet Address.

Since for Planetwatch sensor users there are a lot of transactions with amount = 0 PLANETS in Algoexplorer it is a bit hard to find out the actual transactions with real PLANETS. Therefore I have created a python program to get only the transactions with amount grater than 0 using the algoexplorer API.
